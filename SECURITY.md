# Reporting Security Issues

Security bugs in vex-server are taken semi-seriously. This is a demo application meant to show how the [vex-reader](https://github.com/vdanen/vex-reader) library can be used, but nevertheless if there is a security issue found I'd like to fix it!  I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/vdanen/vex-server/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I'll aim to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. I don't make a very good proxy for those other projects.
